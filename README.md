## Module 00

This day consist of 3 exercises (Megaphone, My Awesome PhoneBook,  The Job Of Your Dreams)
1. Megaphone
In this exercise you have to print all characters in upper-case format.

In this exercise you have to write a program that behaves like a PhoneBook, so you need to implement two classes PhoneBook and Contact plus some stuff inside this classes.

3. The Job Of Your Dreams
